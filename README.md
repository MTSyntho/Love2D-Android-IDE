# Löve2D Android IDE
Code Löve2D Games on your android phone easily!  
This README file is still a work in progress so is the app.

Download [**Sketchware Pro**](https://sketchware-pro.ga/) to use source code and to contribute to the project.  
https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/releases - The .swb file is the source code  
Sketchware Pro is a free modification _its free no premium_ of an application called Sketchware which allows anyone of any age to start coding using blocks, anyone familiar with scratch will not have trouble using the blocks. You can create very good applications using Sketchware and if you really get deep into it you can even create games directly in sketchware so no embedding like html but you can do that if you'd like to. Its only available for android and only exports to android and also if you know java you can use 'add source directly' blocks in the green 'operator' tab to inject that java code into your application if the blocks aren't enough for you. It also allows you to export your project to android studio and continue working from there **but you are not allowed to convert this sketchware project to android studio project, edit it and make a pull request, if you do so minus well fork this repository then upload your android studio source, delete the swb file and compiled apk there.**
